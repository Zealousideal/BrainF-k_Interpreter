# Brainfuck Interpreter

This is a simple Brainfuck interpreter implemented in C programming language. Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language known for its minimalism and extreme simplicity.

Brainfuck, an esoteric programming language, embodies the epitome of minimalism and obscurity. Comprising only eight simple commands, each represented by a single character, Brainfuck challenges conventional programming paradigms with its stark simplicity. Developed by Urban MÃ¼ller in 1993, its design reflects an exercise in extreme reductionism, aimed at creating a Turing-complete language with the fewest possible instructions. Programmers delve into its cryptic syntax, using commands to manipulate a tape of memory cells, crafting intricate algorithms with an economy of expression. While notoriously difficult to comprehend and rarely used in practical applications, Brainfuck remains a fascinating curiosity, illustrating the essence of computational minimalism.Basics of BrainFuck

1. **`>`** : Move the pointer to the right (increment the pointer).
2. **`<`** : Move the pointer to the left (decrement the pointer).
3. **`+`** : Increment the byte at the pointer.
4. **`-`** : Decrement the byte at the pointer.
5. **`[`** : Begin a loop. If the byte at the pointer is zero, jump forward to the command after the matching `]` command.
6. **`]`** : End a loop. If the byte at the pointer is nonzero, jump back to the command after the matching `[` command.
7. **`.`** : Output the byte at the pointer as a character.
8. **`,`** : Accept one byte of input, storing its value in the byte at the pointer.
